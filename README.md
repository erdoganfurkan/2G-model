2G-model, modified CLASS code {#mainpage}
==============================================

Authors: Furkan Erdogan

with the essential help from other people, especially Brahim Lamine, 
Alain Blanchard, Stéphane Ilic, Isaac Tutusaus and Raphaël Kou.

In this git repositary we present a modified version of the CLASS
(Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) code allowing the simulation
the evolution of linear perturbations in the universe and to compute 
CMB and large scale structure observables.

Compiling this modified CLASS is done in the exact same way as its 
vanilla version which you can find here :

https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public

Please follow the instructions on this git link to be able to use
this code.
If you need more information about CLASS, you can also see http://class-code.net

Branches
--------

You can find three branches in this git.
1. Master branch: modified CLASS code to integrate our 2G-model.
2. 2G_no-transition branch: 2G model but without the transition on the G_matter part. The two G are real constants.
3. Variying_G branch: Only one G considered constant but we can change its value.

Using the code
--------------

The vanilla CLASS can be use freely, just needed to cite their paper (see the read.me on the git link above) on your publications.
For this modified version, we ask you, gently, to do the same by citing our paper 
(Cosmological tensions in the light of a two gravitational constants model) on your publications.
